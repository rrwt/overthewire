## Level Goal

[URL](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit22.html).
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/
for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

```shell
ssh bandit21@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ls /etc/cron.d/
cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```
