## Level Goal

[URL](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit21.html).
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you
specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the
previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

```shell
ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
# set up a server on any unused port (& - sends the job to background)
echo -n "0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO" | nc -l -p 1234 &
# ask suconnect to connect to port 1234
./suconnect 1234
```
The password for the next level is: <!-- EeoULMCra2q0dSkYj561DX7s1CpBuOBt -->
