## Level Goal

[URL](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit23.html).
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler.
Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally
made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

```shell
ssh bandit22@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit23
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
> #!/bin/bash
> myname=$(whoami)
> mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
> echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"
> cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
# insight - since the cronjob is running with user bandit23 and you will run this as user bandit22, the destination
# file for your command and the cronjob with be different. To get the destination file for the cronjob, run
echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
```
