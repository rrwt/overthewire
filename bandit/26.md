Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

```shell
# similar to the previous problem, make the shell small
ssh -p 2220 bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
v
:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell
# now we can make the shell bigger
ls -l # prints (bandit27-do  text.txt), bandit27-do is executable
./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
```

The password for the next level is: <!-- upsNCc7vzaRDx6oZC6GiR6ERwe1MowGB -->
