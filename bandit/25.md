## Level Goal

[URL](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit26.html).
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else.
Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

```shell
ssh -p 2220 bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
ls # prints bandit26.sshkey
cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
# prints:/etc/passwd: bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
# this means that /usr/bin/showtext is the shell for bandit26
cat /usr/bin/showtext
# prints: exec more ~/text.txt; exit 0
# This means the shell runs the more command and then exits.
# to make more command interactive, we need to make the terminal window small, otherwise
# it will quickly print the text in the text.txt file and exit. Making it small, makes it
# interactive.
ssh -p 2220 -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
:v # open vi in more
:e /etc/bandit\_pass/bandit26 # open file in vi to see the password
```
