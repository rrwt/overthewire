## Level Goal

[URL](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit14.html).
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14.
For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

```shell
ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
cat sshkey.private
# copy the key to a file (e.g. id_rsa) in your local machine
exit
ssh -i id_rsa -p 2220 bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
```
The password you are looking for is: <!-- MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS -->
