The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

```shell
ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
cd inhere/
# find all files (-type f) and run the command `file` on them.
# The file with type `ASCII text` is the expected one
find . -type f -exec file {} \;
cat ./-file07
```
The password you are looking for is: <!-- 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw -->
