The password for level 2 is in the file ‘krypton2’. It is ‘encrypted’ using a simple rotation. It is also in non-standard ciphertext format.
When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. This
helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text. Enjoy!

cat krypton2 | tr -d '[:space:]' | tr 'A-Z' 'N-ZA-M'
